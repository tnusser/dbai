Assignment 07 - Tobias Nusser & Andreas BÃ¤uerle

######## Overall Status
We chose to implement the second join alogorithm of the assignment, the Sort-Merge-Join. 
We oriented ourselves on the already implemented file NestedLoopEquiJoin for some of the code.

For the tests, we started with implementing the Evaluator Base test further. We added
random Arrays of Boat names and colors, which allowed us to implement the methods to
create test-sets according the Schemas of Reserves and boats.

We implemented the first test: "Test that your algorithm works correctly if you join the two relations on the sid attribute."
