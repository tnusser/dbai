# Minibase for Java

Minibase is a single-user database management system mainly intended for educational use. Students can use Minibase to
study and implement several DBMS components, without support for concurrency control and recovery. The source code of
Java version that is under development at the University of Konstanz is based on Chris Mayfield's Minibase for Java,
which extended and redesigned the initial Java port of the original C/C++ source code. This first version of Minibase
was developed by Raghu Ramakrishnan for the practical exercises that accompany the book Database Management Systems.
Minibase's history traces back to Minirel course project developed by David DeWitt at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.
