/**
 * The buffer manager manages the buffer pool, which consists of a collection of slots (so-called buffer pages) that
 * can hold pages, which have been read into memory. Internally, this buffer pool is represented as an array
 * of page objects. The buffer manager reads disk pages into a main memory page as needed and evicts pages
 * from memory that are no longer required, if the buffer pool has no empty slots to hold new pages. The
 * buffer manager provides the following services.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Pinning and unpinning disk pages to and from buffer.</li>
 * <li>Allocating and deallocating sequences of disk pages and coordinating this with the buffer pool.</li>
 * <li>Reading data from disk into memory pages.</li>
 * <li>Flushing pages from the buffer pool to disk.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The buffer manager is used by access methods, heap files, and relational operators to read, write,
 * allocate, and deallocate pages.
