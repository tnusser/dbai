 * Query execution is driven by a tree of relational operators, all of which are implemented as iterators.
 * Results are requested by successive "get next tuple" calls on the root of the tree, which in turn makes
 * similar calls to child iterators throughout the tree. Intermediate nodes (i.e. join iterators) drive the
 * leaf-level nodes (i.e. file or index scan iterators).
