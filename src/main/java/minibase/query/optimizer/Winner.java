/**
 * A winner identifies the multi-expression that matches a given search context best. Each expression group
 * maintains a set of winners from previous searches. Winners are also used to indicate various states of
 * query optimization. A winner is marked as ready to indicate that the optimization of its plan and all its
 * inputs has completed. In contrast, a winner that is marked as not ready is still being optimized for the
 * corresponding search context. This is used by the query optimizer to detect the attempt to optimize
 * recursive queries, which is not supported. A winner that is marked as ready but has a plan than is
 * {@code null} is used to indicate that the corresponding search context cannot be satisfied by the group.
 * These {@code null} plan winners are not pruned from the group to avoid repeated attempts to optimize for a
 * search context that cannot be satisfied. For winners with a {@code null} plan, the cost represents the
 * upper bound that needs to be met during query optimization.
 * <p>
 * Minibase's query optimizer is based on the Cascades framework for query optimization and, additionally,
 * implements some of the improvements proposed by the Columbia database query optimizer.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Goetz Graefe: <strong>The Cascades Framework for Query Optimization</strong>. In
 * <em>IEEE Data(base) Engineering Bulletin</em>, 18(3), pp. 19-29, 1995.</li>
 * <li>Yongwen Xu: <strong>Efficiency in Columbia Database Query Optimizer</strong>,
 * <em>MSc Thesis, Portland State University</em>, 1998.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The Minibase query optimizer therefore descends from the EXODUS, Volcano, Cascades, and Columbia line of
 * query optimizers, which all use a rule-based, top-down approach to explore the space of possible query
 * execution plans, rather than a bottom-up approach based on dynamic programming.
