/**
 * The rule manager manages all rules that are known to the optimizer and can be used to turn individual rules
 * on an off.
 * <p>
 * Minibase's query optimizer is based on the Cascades framework for query optimization and, additionally,
 * implements some of the improvements proposed by the Columbia database query optimizer.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Goetz Graefe: <strong>The Cascades Framework for Query Optimization</strong>. In
 * <em>IEEE Data(base) Engineering Bulletin</em>, 18(3), pp. 19-29, 1995.</li>
 * <li>Yongwen Xu: <strong>Efficiency in Columbia Database Query Optimizer</strong>,
 * <em>MSc Thesis, Portland State University</em>, 1998.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The Minibase query optimizer therefore descends from the EXODUS, Volcano, Cascades, and Columbia line of
 * query optimizers, which all use a rule-based, top-down approach to explore the space of possible query
 * execution plans, rather than a bottom-up approach based on dynamic programming.
